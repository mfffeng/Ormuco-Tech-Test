# Problems
1. I only provided sketch programs for B and C, even though they ask for "library", because:
    * Individual `.py` files can technically be redistributed and serve as libraries.
    * Formally packaging libraries involves work on its own and is really not the point of the questions.
2. For question 2, I modeled it after my own understanding of how version number works. Adaptations & modifications(e.g., add word characters support) can be made easily pending further specification.  
3. For question 3, I only provided a basic LRU (with timeout) draft implementation, since the geographic and network part are very hard to implement without any instructions.
